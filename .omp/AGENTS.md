# pyweb-gen — session context

Repo: pyweb-gen. Live state: @../STATE.md

## Order of truth

1. User instruction in the current session.
2. STATE.md, injected below (live state, updated every session close).
3. The operating manual @../AGENTS.md: planning, workflow, commit format, tests, determinism, logging.
4. PLAN.md for the current dated plan.

Start omp sessions in this directory; the context above only loads from here.

## Session open

STATE.md is already injected. Then `gh issue list --state open` for the backlog. Read AGENTS.md fully before touching code.

## Session close

Update STATE.md and ship it as a `chore/<n>` PR per AGENTS.md. Leave no uncommitted work behind.
