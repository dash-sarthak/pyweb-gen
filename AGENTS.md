# pyweb-gen — operating manual

Machine-readable first, human-readable second. Any agent or human working here follows this file. Skills live in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Planning lives in `PLAN.md`; live state in `STATE.md`.

## Map

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PLAN.md` | Dated planning entries, newest first. Planning happens here before implementation. |
| `STATE.md` | Live session state, updated at session close. omp sessions get it auto-injected; every other agent reads the file. |
| `.agents/skills/` | The skill catalog this repo ships. Core rules plus language pack. |
| `.omp/` | Native omp context (pointer, sticky rules, memory config). Additive; other agents ignore it. |

## Planning (default first step)

1. Non-trivial work starts as a dated entry in `PLAN.md` (`## YYYY-MM-DD`, newest first) stating the goal, the approach, and how the result gets verified. Trivial fixes skip this.
2. Entries are append-only once the session closes. Corrections arrive as new dated entries, never as edits to old ones.
3. Scope only the user can decide stays a question in the entry until answered. Do not guess and do not shrink scope silently.
4. Then implement: issue, branch, PR, main.

## Workflow: issue → branch → PR → main

1. Every unit of work starts as a GitHub issue. Title prefix: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`.
2. One issue = one branch = one PR. Branch names: `feature/<n>`, `bug/<n>`, `chore/<n>`, `docs/<n>`.
3. Commit format, subject only:

   ```
   [gh-<issue_number>: <what changed>]
   ```

   Example: `[gh-5: add retry with injected clock to scheduler]`. `gh-0` is reserved for bootstrap commits before the tracker exists.
4. PR body: `Closes #<n>`, what changed, and the verification evidence (test run, build output, or measured behavior). No PR without evidence.
5. `main` is the deployment branch. It only moves through PRs with green CI. Merge commits only; squash is forbidden because it destroys the commit trail.
6. Branch protection on `main`: required status check, pull requests required, no force pushes.

## Session open / session close

Open. Read `STATE.md` for live state and `PLAN.md` for the current plan, then `gh issue list --state open` for the backlog. Read this file fully before touching code.

Close. Update `STATE.md` (last merged PR, in flight, open questions, next action) and ship it as a `chore/<n>` PR through the normal flow. Leave no uncommitted work.

## Tests

- Tests assert expected behavior, never implementation details. The test name states the behavior.
- Boundaries are mandatory (`clean-tests` skill): empty input, zero, off-by-one, invalid input, and error paths get tests, not just the happy path.
- Tests are fast, independent, and repeatable in any environment. No network, no real clock, no real randomness.
- Bug fixes land the failing regression test before the fix whenever a cheap test path exists; otherwise state why and use the closest executable check.

## Determinism (non-negotiable)

Non-determinism is the enemy of agent-maintained code. Therefore:

- No wall-clock time or randomness in production logic. Inject a clock and a seeded source as parameters; default implementations live only at the composition edge.
- All time handling is UTC. Human locales apply only at the render edge, fixed explicitly, never from ambient system locale.
- Floating-point values are never compared with equality in tests or code; format with an explicit, fixed function first.
- The lockfile is committed. Dependency installs are frozen. Adding a dependency is a deliberate act, never a side effect of fixing something else.
- No ambient environment reads inside library code. Packages and modules receive configuration as parameters; only the composition root reads the environment.
- No wall-clock sleeps in tests; use fake timers or injected clocks.

## Logging

- JSON only, one event per line, through the project's single logging path. Field order starts `ts`, `level`, `component`, `event`.
- Events are `snake_case` verbs (`tool_opened`, `calculation_completed`). No PII, no free-form messages without an event name.
- A log line must be parseable by `jq` alone. If reading it needs outside context, the event is wrong.

## Code style

- The clean-code catalog lives in `.agents/skills/` (`clean-general`, `clean-names`, `clean-functions`, `clean-comments`, `clean-tests`), orchestrated by `boy-scout`. Fast rules: max 3 function arguments, no flag arguments, no magic numbers, no commented-out code, comments explain why.
- Boy Scout rule: every touched file gets one small improvement, proportionate to the task.
- Writing in docs, PRs, and comments follows `unslop`.

## Gotchas

- (empty by design; agents append project-specific gotchas here as they learn them, one bullet per gotcha)

## Machine-readable artifacts

- Commit subjects, issue titles, and branch names parse by the regexes in this file.
- `PLAN.md` entries start with `## YYYY-MM-DD` headings, newest first.
- `STATE.md` uses fixed section headings: Repo and location, Last merged, In flight, Open questions for the user, Next action.

## Language addendum: Python

### Commands

- Test: `python3 -m pytest` — one module: `python3 -m pytest tests/test_<name>.py`
- Lint and format: `ruff check .` and `ruff format .` (dev dependency, pinned in `requirements-dev.txt`)
- Environments: `python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt`. Both requirements files are committed and pinned.

### Conventions

- PEP 8 naming. Type hints on all public functions. Docstrings state what; comments state why.
- Determinism instantiation: no `datetime.now()`, `time.time()`, `random.*`, or `os.environ` reads outside the composition root (`__main__.py`, `cli.py`). Inject a clock callable and a `random.Random` instance. Tests inject fakes or freeze time.
- Tests live in `tests/`, one file per module under test, pytest style, no network, no real clock, no real randomness.
- Stdlib first. A third-party dependency needs a reason written in the PR that adds it.
- Prefer `pathlib.Path` over `os.path`; dataclasses over dicts for structured data; no mutable default arguments.
