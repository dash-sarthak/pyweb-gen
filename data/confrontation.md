The building stands out starkly in the night, shaped like an abandoned car - dusty, beat up, well past the point of receiving care. It had lived its glory days and now has outlived them into desolation. The once elegant board, made of ornate sweat and cheap paint looks like a tarp abandoned in the night sky A semblance of vibrant red clings to the gray walls, like dying smiles in a washed out polaroid. Gaping holes and boarded cages look back with tired malice from where windows once used to be. Peepal trees with ashen leaves poke the last of their branches from unruly cracks larger than the wall itself, rotten , outstretched hands of those too dead to escape.

Around it lies the ruins of a factory older than the night itself. Left for the dead, it now recites its own lore - a broken building where ghosts of the past, clad in dirty orange jumpsuits and bare feet, walk unchecked. Inside, a few gumboots lie scattered around, silent transient graves filled with rainwater and piss, humming unnamed stories of the evenings past. A small stream of water flows beside, tracing its way back to the city’s leaking pipes and the evening's drizzle, adding to the night’s silence.

The roads beside, dusty skeletal has-beens, coated with dust and dog-shit and fading tire-marks, seamlessly melt into the fields that run up to the horizon. Now lazy scarecrows stand in the middle of the road, morbid traffic control officers with earthen pots for heads. In the far south, a greenhouse of weeds flaps its torn plastic wings. Around it, bushes grow thick and unchecked, strange unnamed constellations, their shadows swaying their hips to the wind’s lewd whistles. A shard of broken glass, memoir to some pauper’s joyous night perhaps, momentarily catches the moonlight, a white sheen among the shadows, until the wind chokes with it dust too.

I lean against the building’s wall, one still stony enough to stand frail bones and wet cigarettes. The soil sizzles under my shoes as the evening's soggy clouds weep fat, murky rain. A bell tolls somewhere in the west, somewhere beyond the hill, perhaps the wind visiting an untold temple in a village, singing odes from greased pages, about valiance of the dead, conquests of the rocks.

I look at the watch climbing slowly into the night. It's almost 8. I take a drag from the cigarette, its dead embers rejoicing from within their wet, cylindrical coffin for one last time.
